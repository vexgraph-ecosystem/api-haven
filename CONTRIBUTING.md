# Contributions & Engineering Manifesto (api-haven)

This project is a strictly solo development process conducted in tight pair-programming partnership with an AI coding assistant.

It serves as an architectural manifesto for a **zero-allocation C23 systems library**, speaking raw memory layouts and native POSIX/macOS primitives through `vexspoke`.

> Legacy note: the original Java surface (`api.APIClient`, zero-GC
> off-heap telemetry) is quarantined under `attic/` and is not built.
> The canonical ports live in `src/api` and `src/com` — extend those,
> never the attic.

## 1. The AI-First Architecture Manifesto & Boilerplate Defense

This codebase strictly enforces the verbose, explicit boilerplate required across the `vexgraph` ecosystem:
- Single Class Per File (the Java Law: one public `typedef struct` per `.h`/`.c` pair).
- Absolute zero allocation in tick, layout, or event loops (no hidden temporaries).
- Complete, symmetric getters and setters for every state-bearing field.
- Explicit pointer discipline (`(*ptr).field`, `(T*) var` casts, `T *name` decls) rather than wrapper types.

### Why the Boilerplate Exists
This boilerplate is **not** an accident, nor is it a misunderstanding of idiomatic C. It is an intentional, machine-verifiable scaffold built specifically for **AI-Human Pair Systems Programming**:
1. **Machine Comprehension**: Explicit pointers and manual field mapping allow an AI coding agent to verify alignment and struct layout with zero ambiguity.
2. **AI-Maintained Rigor**: The AI agent writes and maintains repetitive accessor boilerplate, eliminating human typing toil while ensuring zero steady-state allocation.

## 2. Sanity Warning for External Contributors

> [!WARNING]
> **SANITY NOTICE FOR EXTERNAL CONTRIBUTORS**
> This repository is not designed for traditional C conveniences, casual hacking, or stylistic shortcuts. It is an unapologetic, machine-verifiable manifesto of AI-augmented zero-allocation systems architecture.
>
> **If you do not approve of this architecture or cannot find peace with this philosophy, consider leaving this repository for your own sanity.**
>
> We do not accept Pull Requests, issues, or unsolicited stylistic refactors attempting to re-introduce arrow sugar, collapse classes into shared files, bypass zero-allocation invariants, or resurrect the quarantined Java surface. Upstream is maintained exclusively by the author and the AI agent.

## 3. Supreme Living Document: `../../../preferences.md` & Repo-Local Preferences

All architectural rules and style invariants are governed by the central constitution:

- **[preferences.md](https://gist.github.com/vex-graph/4132a6c45cb6d3797c3e8eff2e94035a)** (one real, Git-ignored workspace-root `../../../preferences.md`, not a tracked Vexspoke file or symlink)
- **[api-haven-preferences.md](api-haven-preferences.md)** (repo-local mirror binding api-haven)

Under the Living Documentation Law, update affected contracts in the same cycle.
Universal changes are published to the existing Gist and byte-verified; repo-local
documentation is committed locally under the Git Workflow Law. Never auto-push.
R3 may borrow Vexspoke CPU computation/behavior or Relational Engine storage/native
C search public contracts; staged migration does not change the default allocator.
